FUTURE
======
1. Add "edit" link from index in administration or just make it default to edit link for people who can edit it?
2. States should change based on the selected country so you only see relevant state options
3. The open/close hours for the stores SUCKS. They look bad and there is no way to say "closed"
4. The accounts table needs so much more information starting with who is active/inactive and expiry dates
5. Move all search results to xxx/search so the breadcrumbs work or maybe create a dedicated search results page?
6. Use CanCan gem to enfore multi-tenancy
7. View dispensing from patient record
9. View sales from patient record
10. Fast add items
11. Lots of business logic around switching cash sale <--> patient, when you can dispense, taxes, etc
