TAX CHANGE
==========
1. Make Tax A and Tax B fixed for a store (i.e. Tax A is HST, Tax B is GST). Include option for rate and if B applies to A
2. Modify the rest of the application so it shows the Tax A and Tax B names (i.e. HST instead of Tax A, GST instead of Tax B)
3. Change inventory so Tax A/B (called by their names) become checkboxes indicating if they apply or not (i.e. check the box next to "HST" to apply Tax A).
